# CodeListHub data

This repo contains the baseline data files for [CodeListHub](https://www.codelisthub.org/en/). 

## Data workflow

For each code list there is:

+ an OpenCodeList meta document
+ a CSV file

CodeListHub imports these files and generates internally:

+ an OpenCodeList document
+ an OpenCodeList meta document
+ a CSV file

## Can I help?

Yes, that would be much appreciated. The best way to help is to post a response via the Issue Tracker and/or submit a Pull Request.
